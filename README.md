Title:
Network Analysis of the Spotify Artist Collaboration Graph

Description: 
Project for the course Complex Network, University of Bologna

Abstract: 
Music is a universal cultural language that transcends borders, eras and social boundaries. It exists in
countless forms and traditions across the world, reflecting the rich diversity of human expression. New music streaming and processing technologies allow a unique data-driven analysis of music and listeners. 
Using Spotify data, a music-artist collaboration network is constructed, involving artists who have charted on Spotify and their collaborators in features.
The network is analysed for degree distribution, clustering and centrality. Centrality is explored by applying the PageRank algorithm.
We also examine how node degree varies with popularity and explore the friendship paradox within the network.
The analysis then shifts toward a genre-based perspective and we investigate genre connectivity by modelling genres as an hypergraph.
Finally, we conduct an examination of the network's community structure using the Louvain community detection algorithm in order to understan the underlying organization of music collaborations.
Results show that the netwrok is scale-free, with a power law degree distribution and highly popular artists acting as central hubs. Louvain community detection reveals well-defined collaboration clus-
ters, largely aligned with genre and industry-driven patterns.

Detailed description and results of this analysis are in the report.
